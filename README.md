## **Problem Description**
The task at hand is to model and build a relational database for the general workings of a bakery business. The central entity in the model is the **Bakery** entity, representing each physical bakery location that the company owns and operates in various areas. 

The bakery operates in conjunction with the **products** it sells, the **ingredients** it sources, the **suppliers** it works with, and the **customers** who purchase from them, whether in-store or via special orders.

We are interested in accurately modeling these relationships, generating sample data, and populating the entities and their attributes with this sample data. Furthermore, we will perform **functional queries** to provide valuable business insights about the bakeryâ€™s operations, such as:
- Tracking **best-selling products**
- Monitoring **ingredient inventory**
- Evaluating **supplier reliability**
- Analyzing **customer purchasing trends**
